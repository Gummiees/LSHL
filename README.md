Love Second Hand Live! is a project I'm developing solo to learn to code with PHP, mySQL and JS. Also to learn web design.

It contains:

  - Profile: Register, login, logout, rating, a profile image, description, username, email, name, address and telephone. Not all editable. Can delete your own profile.
  - Figures: Register, edit and delete. With title, description, price and all the images you want to put on it.
  - Search bar: On the navbar and landing page, on the landing page you can choose how to order the search.
  - Messages: You can send and recieve messages, answer them, delete them from your inbox and mark them as viewed if they are on the inbox.
